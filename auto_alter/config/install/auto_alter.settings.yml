openai_prompt: "Create alt text for an image, following WCAG guidelines, at most 125 characters long.  
Make reasonable inferences only when identifying well-known characters, locations, objects, or text that are clearly visible in the image. 
Do not infer emotions, intentions, or any contextual meaning not directly observable in the image.
1. Begin by describing the main subject, followed by key details, and conclude with visible contextual elements.
2. Include relevant image text verbatim if it's integral to understanding the image.
3. Be clear and include necessary details without over-describing.
4. Avoid repetition and redundancy.
5. Do not make inferences or suggestions (e.g., don't say 'this shows/means/suggests...').
6. Do not begin with 'Alt text:'.
7. Incorporate keywords directly relevant to the image's primary content; avoid keyword stuffing (1-2 keywords max).
8. If the prompt includes a 'Feedback' and/or 'Previous alt text' field, then consider these values and return a new caption."
